            <br>
            <br>
            Owing to the integrated nature and interconnected dependency of components and sub-assemblies that make up electro-mechanical systems, the analysis, design and maintenance of these devices are no longer reliant on just the application of either mechanical, electrical or electronic engineering. Instead, combinations of the engineering skills associated with all of these disciplines are needed. Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays an important role in this as facility operation evolves from being a reactive response to becoming a smart predictive intervention adapted to the actual operational patterns within the facility. This level of intelligence is needed to reach the goal of Smart/Intelligent Buildings, which are a core component in the composition of future Smart Cities.
An Electro-Mechanical engineer can ensure the reliable and efficient functioning of the majority of systems and subsystems that underpin today’s societies.

          <br>
          <br>
          Students joining this programme have the opportunity to start their undergraduate study at BUiD and then transfer to the UK to complete their studies and achieve their undergraduate award. BUiD has agreements with the University of Edinburgh (UoE) and the University of Glasgow (UoG) under which an EM undergraduate student completing his/her 2nd year at BUiD can apply to transfer to a comparable undergraduate programme at the UoE or UoG. If accepted*, the student will join the UK programme at year 3-level and will need to successfully complete two additional academic years upon which he/she will receive their BEng award from the UoE or UoG.The comparable BEng programmes that students can apply to include: Electronics & Electrical Engineering, Aeronautical Engineering, Aerospace Engineering, Mechanical Engineering with Aeronautics, Mechatronics Engineering, Mechatronics, Electronics and Electrical Engineering. A student can also transfer to UoG after completing his/her 1st year at BUiD to join the following UG programmes*: Civil Engineering or Biomedical Engineering.
          <br><br>
          *the transfer requirements include modules taken, grades achieved and English Language proficiency. The exact transfer requirements are set independently and directly by the University of Edinburgh and the University of Glasgow. Contact BUiD for more details about the current requirements.

        <br>
        <br>
        Electro-Mechanical equipment is an integral part of all aspects of our daily lives from HVAC and lighting systems to machinery of different sizes and control systems of many different types of functions. Thus, the potential career opportunities for EM graduates are vast and span across a wide range of organisations and job roles. Gradates of the EM BSc programme will be equipped with the broad range of knowledge and skill sets that make them employable in a wide range of public and private organisations. These attributes provide our graduates with the foundations required to build a career as a professional engineer in roles as systems’ designers, consultants, contractors, and operational & maintenance managers. Such career opportunities are available in most federal ministries, local government organisations, real estate developers, manufacturing companies, power supply companies and building energy services companies as well as in specialised facilities such as hotels, hospitals and manufacturing plants. Graduating with our BSc in Electro-Mechanical Engineering degree is the first step in building your professional Electro-Mechanical engineering career.
